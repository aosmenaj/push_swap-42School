# ðŸ”„ Push_Swap - 42 School Project

## ðŸ“– Description

**Push_Swap** is a sorting algorithm project from the [42 School](https://42.fr) curriculum.  
The goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations, following strict performance constraints.  
You must write a program that outputs the smallest possible list of operations to sort data on a stack, using only allowed moves.

The challenge focuses on **algorithmic efficiency**, **data structure design**, and **optimal operation planning**.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

The program takes a list of integers as arguments:

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1
